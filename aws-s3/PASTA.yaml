PASTA:
  - stage: Define the Objectives
    outcome: A highly available and secure solution for remote storing of the HR system backups with sensitive PII data
    requirements:
  - stage: Define the Technical Scope
    components: 
      service: on-premise HR software
      storage: AWS S3
      networking: Internet
    dependencies:
  - stage: Decompose the Application
    data flow: Backups will be uploaded to the AWS S3 bucket from the on-premise HR system. Data will be transferred via the Internet. In case of disaster, the backup will be downloaded from the S3 bucket by the HR system admin to launch the restoration process.
    users and roles:
  - stage: Analyze the Threats
    framework: STRIDE
      Spoofing: unauthorized access to the backups using an anonymous user
      Tampering: backups data modification
      Repudiation: cleanup of the audit trails
      Information Disclosure: data exposure, man-in-the-middle attack
      Denial of Service: volumetric DDoS attack
      Elevation of Privilege: backups removal
  - stage: Vulnerability Analysis
  - stage: Attack Analysis
  - stage: Risk and Impact Analysis
    - risk: high, backups damage (modification, deletion)
      impact: unable to restore the data in case of disaster
      mitigation: apply WORM configuration (S3 Object Lock), enable S3 versioning
    - risk: high, data exposure
      impact: reputation lost, penalties
      mitigation: enforce TLS v1.2 or higher
